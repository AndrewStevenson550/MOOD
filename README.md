# ðŸŒˆ Mood Board Dashboard

A creative space built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript where ideas, images, and colors come together. This isnâ€™t just a simple app â€” itâ€™s a personal canvas that lets you capture inspiration, arrange your thoughts, and make them visually yours.

# âœ¨ Why I Built This

Sometimes, coding can feel like problem after problem. But projects like this remind me that code is also about expression. I wanted a small but meaningful challenge, something between playful and practical. The Mood Board Dashboard is just that: a project that looks good, feels interactive, and shows how even beginner-friendly tools can create something inspiring.

# ðŸ›  Features

ðŸ–¼ Add custom cards with text, images, or colors.

ðŸ’¾ Autosave with LocalStorage â€” your board stays the way you left it.

ðŸŽ¨ Modern design using CSS grid, soft shadows, and clean typography.

# ðŸš€ What I Learned

How to combine DOM manipulation with real user interaction.

How saving data with LocalStorage makes a project feel alive.

The importance of design â€” not just making things work, but making them enjoyable to use.

# ðŸŒŸ Why It Matters

This project is more than a grid of boxes. Itâ€™s a small reminder that coding can shape creativity. By making something interactive and personal, I can show that even simple web dev skills can create apps that people actually want to use.

# ðŸ“Œ Next Steps

Add themes (dark mode, pastel mode, etc.).

Let users export their boards as images.

Build a mini gallery view for multiple boards.

# ðŸ‘‰ This is just the start â€” and thatâ€™s what makes it exciting.
